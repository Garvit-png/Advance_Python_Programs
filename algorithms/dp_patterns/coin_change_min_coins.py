"""
Coin Change â€” minimum coins to make an amount.

Easy explanation:
- Given coin denominations, find the least number of coins to make a target amount.
- DP: dp[x] = fewest coins to make x. For each coin, dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x-coin] + 1).

Time complexity: O(n * amount) where n = number of coins.
Space complexity: O(amount).
