"""
0/1 Knapsack â€” maximize value with weight limit.

Easy explanation:
- You have items with (weight, value). Each item can be taken once (0/1).
- Goal: maximize value without exceeding capacity.
- DP builds a table: dp[i][w] = best value using first i items with capacity w.

Time complexity: O(n * W) where n = items, W = capacity.
Space complexity: O(n * W) for table (can be optimized to O(W)).
